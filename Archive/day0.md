## Day 0 - Intro to CS

It's my day 0 and I am starting with CS50 and excited too, but it's not my first ever coding class, before this I know some programming basics to intermediate concepts in high school. Lets get started ðŸš€

## What is computer science?

It is the study of how computers work and to solve problems efficiently.

## Representation of numbers through decimal and binary systems and text through ASCII

*Numbers:*
If we want to count the number of people sitting in a room, we can do it simply by using our fingers one at a time. This is called a unary system & if we want to count higher than that we might use ten's digits, 0-9 with a system called Decimal.n the case of computers, they use a very simple system called binary with two digits 1(High voltage) & 0(Low voltage) by using transistors. With the combination and pattern of these digits/events, computers interpret numbers.
Each binary digit is called a bit.<br />

To count higher than 7, we would need another bit to the left to represent the number 8.
Most computers use 8 bits at a time, like [ 00000011 = 3 ].

Here's how you can convert any binary â†’ decimal

*Texts:*
Letters are also represented in 0s and 1s, in a standard mapping called [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). For example, letter 'A' is represented as 65 and 'a' as 97. With eight bits, or one byte, we can have 2^8^, or 256 different values (including zero).

## Images, video & sounds:
Colors can also be represented by 0s and 1s with one of a system called [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model), which can represent any color by indicating the amount of red, green and blue. Images can be formed by the combination of small units of these colors called as [pixels](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24012/pixel)

[Here is an example of a pixel in a photo](https://www.javatpoint.com/concept-of-pixel)

Videos are nothing indeed photos when played in a sequence one by one like a [flipbook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWq-s26YCG8)
