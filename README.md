This repository is where I am documenting my learnings from [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) and on my way to become a self-taught coder in the future. The main agenda is to learn and build in public so that it helps others who want to follow the same route and of course expanding my network! <br />
